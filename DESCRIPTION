Title: 'Coroutines' for R

Authors@R: c(

Description: Provides 'coroutines' for R, a family of functions that can
    be suspended and resumed later on. This includes 'async' functions
    (which await) and generators (which yield). 'Async' functions are
    based on the concurrency framework of the 'promises' package.
    Generators are based on a dependency free iteration protocol defined
    in 'coro' and are compatible with iterators from the 'reticulate'
    package.

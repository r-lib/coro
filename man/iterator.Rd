\description{
An \strong{iterator} is a function that implements the following
protocol:
\itemize{
\item Calling the function advances the iterator. The new value is
returned.
\item When the iterator is exhausted and there are no more elements to return,
\code{coro::exhausted()} or (equivalently) \code{as.symbol(".__exhausted__.")} is
returned. This signals exhaustion to the caller.
\item Once an iterator has signalled exhaustion, all subsequent
invokations must consistently return \code{coro::exhausted()} or
\code{as.symbol(".__exhausted__.")}.
\item The iterator function may have a \code{close} argument taking boolean
values. When passed a \code{TRUE} value, it indicates early termination
and the iterator is given the opportunity to clean up resources.

Cleanup must only be performed once, even if the iterator is called
multiple times with \code{close = TRUE}.

An iterator is allowed to not have any \code{close} argument. Iterator
drivers must check for the presence of the argument. If not present,
the iterator can be dropped without cleanup.

An iterator passed \code{close = TRUE} must return \code{coro::exhausted()} and
once closed, an iterator must return \code{coro::exhausted()} when called
again.
}

Because iteration is defined by a protocol, creating iterators is
free of dependency. However, it is often simpler to create
iterators with \link[=generator]{generators}, see
\code{vignette("generator")}. To loop over an iterator, it is simpler
to use the \code{\link[=loop]{loop()}} and \code{\link[=collect]{collect()}} helpers provided in this
package.

\section{Properties}{


Iterators are \strong{stateful}. Advancing the iterator creates a
persistent effect in the R session. Also iterators are
\strong{one-way}. Once you have advanced an iterator, there is no going
back and once it is exhausted, it stays exhausted.

Iterators are not necessarily finite. They can also represent
infinite sequences, in which case trying to exhaust them is a
programming error that causes an infinite loop.

\section{The exhausted sentinel}{


Termination of iteration is signalled via a sentinel value,
\code{as.symbol(".__exhausted__.")}. Alternative designs include:
\itemize{
\item A condition as in python.
\item A rich value containing a termination flag as in Javascript.
}

The sentinel design is a simple and efficient solution but it has a
downside. If you are iterating over a collection of elements that
inadvertently contains the sentinel value, the iteration will be
terminated early. To avoid such mix-ups, the sentinel should only
be used as a temporary value. It should be created from scratch by
a function like \code{coro::exhausted()} and never stored in a container
or namespace.
